# Kuba -- A marbles board game simulator

## Game start:
- Either player pushes one of their respective marbles. Then the other player pushes one of their respective marbles. Turns alternate.

## Winning the game:
- Once a player pushes seven red marbles off the board, they win.
- If the one player has no legal moves, the other player wins by default.

## Rules for moving marbles:
- A player may only push his own marble (either black or white)
- There must be room to PUSH the marble. Meaning there must be an empty space or board edge on the side the marble is pushed from.
- No undoing the opposing player's turn by pushing the marbles back into the EXACT same position they were in previously.
